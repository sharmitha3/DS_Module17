## Algorithm
1.Define a struct node with an integer vertex and a pointer to the next node.
2.Create a function createNode that takes an integer v.
3.Allocate memory for a new node.
4.Set the nodeâ€™s vertex value to v and next pointer to NULL.
5.Return the pointer to the new node.  

## Program:
```

struct node* createNode(int v) {
    struct node* newNode=malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    newNode->vertex=v;
    newNode->next=NULL;

## Result:
Thus, the C code for the function createNode to traverse the graph below in the depth first fashion is implemented successfully
